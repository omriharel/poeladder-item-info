    text: "Medved can only be found in encounters with the 'Druids of the Broken Circle' in ilvl 68+ Expedition Logbooks. This boss does NOT have a guaranteed unique drop. If your Logbook has a higher ilvl then you may be able to farm a rarer Expedition boss such as Uhtred (ilvl75+) or Olroth (ilvl81+)."
